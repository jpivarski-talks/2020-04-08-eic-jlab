## Uproot and Awkward Arrays: tutorial for Electron Ion Collider users

Jim Pivarski (Princeton University)

### How to participate

This tutorial was presented to the Electron Ion Collider group on April 8, 2020 at 10am EDT. See [the agenda](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/8242/).

The preferred way to participate is to run the JupyterLab code with us, evaluating the code and asking "what if" questions as we go along.

You can run all of these notebooks on a public cloud service called Binder:

To run everything on your own laptop, use pip to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and open [2020-04-08-eic-jlab-UNEVALUATED.ipynb](2020-04-08-eic-jlab-UNEVALUATED.ipynb) in Jupyter.
