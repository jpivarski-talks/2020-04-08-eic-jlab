## Uproot and Awkward Arrays

Tutorial for Electron Ion Collider users, presented on April 8, 2020 at 10am EDT by [Jim Pivarski](mailto:pivarski@princeton.edu) (Princeton University).

See [the agenda](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/8242/).

## How to participate

The preferred way to participate is to run the JupyterLab code with us, evaluating the code and asking "what if" questions as we go along.

You can run all of these notebooks on a public cloud service called Binder:

To run everything on your own laptop, use pip to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and open [2020-04-08-eic-jlab-UNEVALUATED.ipynb](2020-04-08-eic-jlab-UNEVALUATED.ipynb) in Jupyter.
